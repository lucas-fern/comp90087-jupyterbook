# Summary

## Ethical Theories

In this subject we look at **normative** ethical theories, which help us answer questions like:
- How should I act?
- What standards of behaviour should I adopt?
- What sort of person should I be?

Normative Ethics
: The branch of moral philosophy concerned with the criteria of what is morally *right* and *wrong*. (As opposed to [*meta-ethics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics) or [*applied ethics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_ethics)).

### Utilitarianism

```{margin} 
Consequentialism
: An ethical theory which holds that the consequences of one's actions are the basis by which they should be judged. Utilitarianism is a *version* of consequentialism.

Teleological
: Utilitarianism is *teleological* since it posits that morality is primarily about attaining a certain *goal* (the maximisation of utility). Since it is a teleological theory, a utilitarian may believe that *"the ends justify the means"* of an action that other theories may object to. Deontology opposes this since it considers actions themselves to be right or wrong.
```
Utilitarianism teleological moral theory that says we ought to measure right and wrong according to an action's consequences, specifically the action's effect on overall happiness or wellbeing.

```{admonition} Variants of Utilitarianism
:class: note
In contemporary philosophy, utilitarianism can be further divided into more specific moral theories which aim to maximise different measures of *utility*. These include:
- classical utilitarianism (uses overall happiness or pleasure as the measure of utility)
- preference utilitarianism (which values actions that fulfil the most *preferences* or *personal interests* rather than maximising pleasure)

Distinctions are also made between:
- act utilitarianism (covered in the lecture - which considers the results consequences of each single act individually, as opposed to...)
- rule utilitarianism (which considers the consequences of following that action as a rule of conduct.)

### Deontology

Deontology is a *non-teleological* ethical theory that considers actions themselves to be good or bad based on a set of rules, rather than based on the consequences of the actions. Different formulations of deontological ethics consider different rules to be *moral obligations*.

#### W. D. Ross

Proposes that there exist *prima facie* duties that determine what is right and which should be taken at face value.

These include:
1. **Fidelity.** Keep promises and be honest and truthful.
2. **Reparation.** Make amends when we have wronged someone.
3. **Gratitude.** Be grateful when others benefit us and try to return favour.
4. **Non-injury (or non-maleficence).** Refrain from harming others physically or psychologically.
5. **Beneficence.** Be kind and try to improve othersâ€™ health, wisdom, security, happiness, and well-being.
6. **Self-improvement.** Strive to improve our own health, wisdom, security, happiness, and well-being.
7. **Justice**. Be fair and distribute benefits and burdens equably and evenly

When these rules conflict, judgement is required to resolve the conflicts. One rule may be determined to override another.

#### Kantian Deontology

```{margin} 
Maxim
: A moral rule or principle.

Categorical Imperative
: The central philosophical concept to Kantian deontology, which states that one should *"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."*
```

Posits that actions are justified if they align with the **categorical imperative**:
- are based only on *maxims* that one would will to become a **universal law**,
- never treat humans (or other autonomous beings) as simply a means to an end.
  - we should not use people to achieve our own goals without considering their goals and humanity.
  - we should consider that all beings have inherent worth, including ourselves.


### Other Ethical Theories and Definitions

Religious Ethics
: Encompasses the wide range of religious origins that are proposed as the source of moral authority.

Nihilism
: In short, the rejection of all religious and moral principles, in the belief that life is meaningless.

Egoism
: An ethical theory that treats self-interest as the foundation of morality.
