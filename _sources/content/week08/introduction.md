# Tutorial 8: AI and the Law
In week 7, guest lecturer Jeannie Paterson discussed the legal and regulatory aspects of AI. Different models of AI regulation were investigated and compared by looking at the rights they aim to protect, and how they achieve these protections.

In this tutorial we will:
1. Reinforce our understanding of the legal and regulatory aspects governing AI systems.
2. Consider instances of misleading AI systems and ask how these may cause harm, and how they should be regulated.
