## Ethical Theories

### Virtue Ethics

```{margin}
Normative Ethics
: The branch of moral philosophy concerned with the criteria of what is morally *right* and *wrong*. (As opposed to [*meta-ethics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics) or [*applied ethics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_ethics)).

Consequentialism
: An ethical theory which holds that the consequences of one's actions are the basis by which they should be judged. Utilitarianism is a *version* of consequentialism.
```

Virtue ethics (also known as *aretaic* ethics) is an ethical theory that emphasises *being a virtuous individual* as central to making ethical decisions. This is in contrast to consequentialism, which focuses on the outcome of our actions, and deontology, which considers whether our actions uphold our moral duties.

```{margin}
Eudemonia
: A state of excellence brought about through the *exercise of moral virtue*, practical wisdom, and rationality.
```

Key to the theory of virtue ethics are the *virtues* which one should uphold to achieve ***eudemonia***, and the *vices* that should be avoided.

#### Aristotle's Doctrine of Golden Mean

The *golden mean* is the desirable and moral middle ground between two extremes. On the low extreme, we have the vice of **deficiency**, and on the high extreme, **excess**.

Some examples of virtues and vices on this spectrum are:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Vice (Deficiency)</th>
    <th>Virtue</th>
    <th>Vice (Excess)</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Stingy</td>
    <td>Generous</td>
    <td>Extravagant</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mean</td>
    <td>Benevolent</td>
    <td>Self-sacrificing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cowardly</td>
    <td>Brave</td>
    <td>Rash</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Care Ethics

Care ethics is a normative ethical theory that proposes that morality is based on caring and benevolent *interpersonal relationships*. The theory emphasizes the importance of recognising individuality and taking these differences into account when making decisions that impact others. 

It criticises the generalised nature of other ethical theories for their failure to appropriately consider individual differences, resulting in *moral blindness* and *indifference*.

[Carol Gilligan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Gilligan) is considered the creator of the theory, which has been further developed by feminist and environmentalist groups since the 1980s.

#### Developments from Joan Tronto

In her 1993 book *Moral Boundaries*, Tronto identifies 4 moral qualities that align with the 4 phases of care. These qualities (taken from her 2013 book *Caring Democracy: Markets, Equality, and Justice*) are:
1. **Attentiveness** (caring *about*). In the first phase of care, someone notices unmet caring needs. This calls for the moral quality of *attentiveness*, of a suspension of oneâ€™s self-interest, and a capacity genuinely to look from the perspective of the one in need.
2. **Responsibility** (caring *for*). Once needs are identified, someone or some group has to take on the burden of meeting those needs. This is *responsibility*, and that is the key moral quality of this second phase.
3. **Competence** (care *giving*). Assuming responsibility is not yet the same as doing the actual work of care; doing such work is the third phase of caring and requires the moral quality of *competence*.
4. **Responsiveness** (care *receiving*). Once care work is done, there will be a response from the person, group, animal, plant, environment, or thing that has been cared for. Observing that response, and making judgments about it (for example, whether the care given was sufficient, successful, or complete?) requires the moral quality of *responsiveness*. 

Since 1993, Tronto has acknowledged an additional set of qualities (identified by another author, Selma Sevenhuijsen) necessary for effective care. This is again taken from her 2013 book, *Caring Democracy: Markets, Equality, and Justice*.

- **Plurality, communication, trust and respect; solidarity** (caring *with*). This involves making care a priority. It emphasises communication, trust, and respect as the qualities that will make it possible for people to take collective responsibility for the caring needs of all members of society.

Tronto acknowledges that this is not a comprehensive list of moral qualities, and agrees that characteristics like **hope**, **gratitude**, and **cheerfulness** (among others) could be part of a more complete list. 

### Principlism

Derived from medical ethics, the 4 *principles* of principlism are:
1. **Non-maleficence** (do no harm). Predict harm, avoid causing harm, minimize harm in both the short and long term.
2. **Beneficence** (do good). Anticipate and act to achieve good outcomes in both the short and long term.
3. **Respect Autonomy** (respect people's values, choices, *preferences*, and plans). Understand what others value, don't override their choices.
4. **Justice** (fairness). Distribute benefits and harms fairly. Implement fair processes, and don't unfairly discriminate.

In 2018, Luciano Floridi et al. propose an extension to the framework used in medical ethics so that principlism can be applied more effectively to AI. They add a 5th principle:
  
- **Explicability** (intelligibility, transparency, and accountability). Make it clear how the systems we implement work, and who is responsible for the way they work.

```{note}
I thought [this was a nice summary of Floridi's version of principlism](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/l0jsh9d1), if you're interested in some extra reading.
