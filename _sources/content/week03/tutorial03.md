# Tutorial 3: The History of AI
In the week 2 lecture, Tim discussed the key historical eras of AI development and highlighted the importance of representing diverse points of view in discussions of AI ethics. The content this week emphasises the fact that it can be important to look at the past for guidance on making decisions in the present.

The aims of this tutorial are two-fold:
1. To explore the relationship between the history of AI/CS and digital ethics.
2. To analyse ethical considerations of a particular application using the idea of a *pre-mortem*.
