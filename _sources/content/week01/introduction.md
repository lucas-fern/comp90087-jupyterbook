## A Current Note on Academic Integrity
You are *not* prohibited from using ChatGPT in this subject, we are aware it exists, and that some students will use it to complete their assessments. ***However***, the assessments are designed with this in mind. Achieving good marks in the essays will require academic referencing, references to specific lecture content, and *deeper analysis than ChatGPT (currently) provides*.

The [university's policy on "Artificial Intelligence Tools and Technologies"](https://academicintegrity.unimelb.edu.au/plagiarism-and-collusion/artificial-intelligence-tools-and-technologies) as they relate to Academic Integrity states:
> If a student uses artificial intelligence software such as ChatGPT or QuillBot to generate material for assessment that they represent as their own ideas, research and/or analysis, they are **NOT** submitting their own work. Knowingly having a third party, including artificial intelligence technologies, write or produce any work (paid or unpaid) that a student submits as their own work for assessment is deliberate cheating and is academic misconduct.
>
> *If a student uses AI generated material in the preparation of their assessment submission, this must be appropriately acknowledged and cited in accordance with the [Assessment and Results Policy](https://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1326).*
