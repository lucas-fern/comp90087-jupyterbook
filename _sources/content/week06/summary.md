# Summary

## Principlism

Derived from medical ethics, the 4 *principles* of principlism are:
1. **Non-maleficence** (do no harm). Predict harm, avoid causing harm, minimize harm in both the short and long term.
2. **Beneficence** (do good). Anticipate and act to achieve good outcomes in both the short and long term.
3. **Respect Autonomy** (respect people's values, choices, *preferences*, and plans). Understand what others value, don't override their choices.
4. **Justice** (fairness). Distribute benefits and harms fairly. Implement fair processes, and don't unfairly discriminate.

In 2018, Luciano Floridi et al. propose an extension to the framework used in medical ethics so that principlism can be applied more effectively to AI. They add a 5th principle:
  
- **Explicability** (intelligibility, transparency, and accountability). Make it clear how the systems we implement work, and who is responsible for the way they work.

I thought [this was a nice summary of Floridi's version of principlism](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/l0jsh9d1), if you're interested in some extra reading.
