# Tutorial 11: Explainable AI (XAI)

This week we discuss *explainability*, an field of AI ethics which looks at increasing human understanding of the decisions made by AI systems. Explanations answer the question of *why* our models produce the results they do.

The aims of the tutorial on Explainability are as follows:

1. To critically assess the important factors that we want in explainability
2. To evaluate different explainability approaches on a real example.
