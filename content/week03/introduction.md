# Summary

## Timeline
I haven't copied the timeline into these notes since I don't have much to add here for the tutorial. Refer to [the lecture slides](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/151263/files/14104343?module_item_id=4520941) if you need a recap.

Very briefly, the events/eras covered in the timeline are:
- The Turing Test (1950)
- The Golden Age of AI (1956-1974)
- The First AI Winter (1974-1980)
- The Knowledge Era (1980-1987)
- The Second AI Winter (1987-1993)
- The AI Revival (1994-Present)

### AI Winters
Caused by a tendency to overhype recent developments and overestimate the impact they will have on society.

```{epigraph}
We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. 

-- Amara's Law
```

AI has failed to live up to hype for various reasons, including:
- an inability to scale up ideas that work in small-scale tests,
- limitations of the models available at the time,
- Moravec's paradox
  - the observation that, contrary to what was traditionally believed, *reasoning* requires relatively little computation, but sensing, perception, and recreating motor skills require large amounts of computation
- the qualification problem
  - the impossibility of listing all the preconditions required for a real-world action to have its intended effect

## History and Representation
Research in AI, including ethics, has been driven mostly by males from western societies (take the ["Founding Fathers of AI"](https://www.scienceabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/John-maccarthy-marvin-minsky-claude-shannon-ray-solomonoff-alan-newell-herbert-simon-arthur-samuel-oliver-selfridge-nathaniel-rochester-trenchard-more-the-founding-fathers-of-ai.webp) who attended the Dartmouth Conference for example).

Diversity is recognised as being important, but people from non-Western backgrounds and of non-male genders are still marginalised and under-represented. Males are still represented at a vastly higher rate than other genders according to research conducted by Marc and Simon in 2021:

### Effects of Under-representation
A lack of diversity and representation can result in a lack of:
- privacy
- fairness
- accessibility & inclusion
- safety
- transparency
- functionality

### Types of Diversity
When forming teams to work on problems in AI (and other domains) we should seek diversity in areas such as:
- gender
- culture
- ethnicity
- sexual orientation
- disability
- family status
- age
- class
- education
- and more!
