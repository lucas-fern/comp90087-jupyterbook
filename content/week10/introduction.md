# Tutorial 10: Data Governance

The aims of the tutorial on Data Governance are as follows:
1. To gain an awareness of the data being collected about us, internet users, on a regular basis when engaging with popular websites.
2. To critically discuss the data collection policies of tech companies and to critique them from an ethical standpoint.
3. To be aware of privacy-protecting technologies that help us as tech consumers opt-out of such data collection.
4. To critically discuss a case study/thought experiment on the ethics of data governance.
