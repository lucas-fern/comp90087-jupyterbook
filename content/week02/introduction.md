# Tutorial 2: Trust, Power, and Machines
In the week 1 lecture, Tim discussed the types of trust relations that can exist between humans and machines using the model of contractual trust. In this tutorial we consider a specific application of AI, look at the trust relations that surround it, and discuss use, misuse, disuse, and abuse of machines. We additionally consider the model of user trust discussed in the lecture, and consider how power imbalances affect the ethics of implementing AI.

The aims of this tutorial are two-fold:
1. To reinforce your understanding of the relationship between (contractual) trust and digital ethics.
2. To critically analyse a particular application and discuss the strengths and limitations of it with respect to trust and digital ethics.
