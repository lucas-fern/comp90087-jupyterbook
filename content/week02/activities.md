# Tutorial 2 Activities
Automated essay grading is the use of software to automatically assign (part of) a grade for a written essay.

According to a [2019 research article](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2019/0879.pdf), the following factors are used to assign grades:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Dimension</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Grammar</td>
    <td>Use of grammar</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Usage</td>
    <td>Use of prepositions, word usage</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mechanics</td>
    <td>Spelling, punctuation, capitalisation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Style</td>
    <td>Word choice, sentence structure</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Relevance</td>
    <td>Relevance of the content to the prompt</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Organisation</td>
    <td>How well the essay is structured</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Development</td>
    <td>Development of ideas with examples</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cohesion</td>
    <td>Appropriate use of transition phrases</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Coherence</td>
    <td>Appropriate transitions between ideas</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Thesis clarity</td>
    <td>Clarify of the thesis/argument</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persuasiveness</td>
    <td>Convincingness of the major argument</td>
  </tr>

Imagine that the COMP90087 subject coordinators decide to use an automated essay grading tool that uses state-of-the-art in natural language processing technology. The tool uses the factors listed above to assign a grade.

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} Task 1
Discuss in your group:
1. How would you react if you were told about the COMP90087 coordinators' decision?
2. Using the model of contractual trust, list three of the factors from the table in the notes (reproduced below) that you think an automated essay grading tool would be unlikely to uphold?
3. What are some of the ethical risks that could occur if these factors/contracts are not upheld? Use the model from lecture of how power and trust intersect.
4. For these risks, analyse these against the concepts of use, misuse, abuse, and disuse of machines. Are the risks caused by misuse, abuse, or disuse?

```{note}
Nominate a note taker to record your answers. Put your answers in the text of [the forum discussion post](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/151263/discussion_topics/870506), rather than as an attachment, to encourage others to read your notes.

This is a "holdout" task that we are not giving out in advance, as it will affect your answers to Task 1.
