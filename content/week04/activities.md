# Tutorial 4 Activities


## Pre-readings
Hopefully you've already read the New York Times article ["Wrongfully Accused by an Algorithm"](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html) (also available [on the LMS](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/151263/files/14104443)).

Additionally, you may benefit from reading ["Facial recognition: top 7 trends (tech, vendors, use cases)"](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/biometrics/facial-recognition) if you aren't already familiar with facial recognition technology.

## Activities

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} Task 1: Face Recognition
> *Face recognition systems use machine learning algorithms to pick out specific, distinctive details about a person’s face, like distance between the eyes or shape of the chin. These are converted into a mathematical representation and compared to data on other faces collected in a face recognition database e.g. from millions of pictures scraped from websites and social media.*

You have already been introduced to facial recognition. In this tutorial, we will explore it in more detail and from the perspective of ethical theory.

```{admonition} Exercise
:class: hint
Is facial recognition ethically justified? In your groups, choose **two out of three** of the following cases and explore whether they are justified. Include an analysis from the perspectives of **utilitarianism** and **deontology**.

1. Law enforcement
2. Class attendance at university
3. City-wide street surveillance for finding missing persons
```

````{tab-item} Task 2: Emotion Recognition
> *Emotion or 'affect' recognition aims to use machine learning to detect emotions, potentially even very subtle ones—although there is debate about its accuracy—on faces in videos.*

```{admonition} Exercise
:class: hint
Is emotion recognition ethically justified? Explore one or more of these cases:

1. Job interviews
2. To diagnose depression in patients
3. In shopping centres to analyse shopper behaviour
```
