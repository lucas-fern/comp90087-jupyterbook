# Tutorial 12: AI and Art

In the final tutorial for this subject, we consider the ethical implications of recent generative AI models that are used to produce art. We consider the data sets that are used to train these models, the artists they may replace, and the new opportunities this technology brings.

The aims of this tutorial are:

1. To discuss the ethics of using images harvested from the internet to train generative AI models.
2. To consider the potential consequences of future developments in generative AI.
3. **To answer any questions you have about content from previous weeks.**
4. **To get your feedback about the lectures, assignments, and tutorials :)**
