``````{tab-item} Task 1: Data Sets

Generative AI can scrape data from artists which can then find its way into the outputs. For example, some AI outputs may resemble the paintings of a particular painter. Some of these artists are relatively unknown artists and others are more famous. The works of these artists can often be found online, either posted there by the artists or by other parties.

2. What does, or should, the law say about this use of data?

``````{tab-item} Task 2: The Future

Imagine a future in which generative AI gets as good as human artists at making art.

*e.g.* visual art, music, novels, poems.


```{admonition} Exercise
:class: hint

1. Has this future already arrived? If not, will it? Can an AI ever be as good an artist as a human being?
2. If AI produces first-rate art, should we still continue to provide opportunities for human artists (*e.g.* public grants, education, training)? What would be the point?
