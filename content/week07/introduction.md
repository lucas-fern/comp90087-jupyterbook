# Tutorial 6: Transparency
In week 6, Marc introduced *transparency*, an important consideration when making decisions and implementing processes. This is different to the concept of *explainability* (covered later in the subject) which is instead concerned with the interpretability of our algorithms.

In this tutorial we will:
1. Reinforce our understanding of transparency, and emphasise why it is important at all stages of an Automated Decision-Making (ADM) process.
2. To critically discuss the often *opaque* data collection policies of social media companies and their purported 'transparency'.
3. To critically discuss recent cases in digital ethics involving non-transparent processes and to critique them from various ethical standpoints.
