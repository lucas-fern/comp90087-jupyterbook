# Tutorial 5: Virtue and Care Ethics
In the week 4 lecture, Simon introduced *virtue ethics*, *care ethics*, and *principlism*. Similar to the theories we discussed last week, these will help us answer questions about what decisions are morally right and wrong. You are required to use these theories in your assignments to answer practical ethical questions.

In this tutorial we will:
1. Reinforce our understanding of virtue ethics and care ethics
2. Use these theories to evaluate the ethical suitability of a predictive policing AI system
